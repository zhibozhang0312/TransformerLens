    "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens), a library for mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2 style transformer language models. A core design principle of the library is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate what exploratory analysis looks like in practice with the library. I use my standard toolkit of basic mechanistic interpretability techniques to try interpreting a real circuit in GPT-2 small. Check out [the main demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Main_Demo.ipynb) for an introduction to the library and how to use it. \n",

    "\n",
    "Details tags contain asides, flavour + interpretability intuitions. These are more in the weeds and you don't need to read them or understand them, but they're helpful if you want to learn how to do mechanistic interpretability yourself! I star the ones I think are most important.\n",

    "A good starting point is thinking though whether a tiny model could do this, eg a <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html\">1L Attn-Only model</a>. I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (eg the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending 0.3 to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending 0.6 to a single John token. So this will be pretty hard to figure out on the \" to\" token!\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural place to break this symmetry is on the second \" John\" token - telling whether there is an earlier copy of the <i>current</i> token should be a much easier task. So I might expect there to be a head which detects duplicate tokens on the second \" John\" token, and then another head which moves that information from the second \" John\" token to the \" to\" token. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model then needs to learn to predict \" Mary\" and <i>not</i> \" John\". I can see two natural ways to do this: \n",
    "1. Detect all preceding names and move this information to \" to\" and then delete the any name corresponding to the duplicate token feature. This feels easier done with a non-linearity, since precisely cancelling out vectors is hard, so I'd imagine an MLP layer deletes the \" John\" direction of the residual stream\n",
    "2. Have a head which attends to all previous names, but where the duplicate token features <i>inhibit</i> it from attending to specific names. So this only attends to Mary. And then the output of this head maps to the logits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(Spoiler: It's the second one).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Experiment Ideas</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A test that could distinguish these two is to look at which components of the model add directly to the logits - if it's mostly attention heads which attend to \" Mary\" and to neither \" John\" it's probably hypothesis 2, if it's mostly MLPs it's probably hypothesis 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we should be able to identify duplicate token heads by finding ones which attend from \" John\" to \" John\", and whose outputs are then moved to the \" to\" token by V-Composition with another head (Spoiler: It's more complicated than that!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of the above reasoning is very simplistic and could easily break in a real model! There'll be significant parts of the model that figure out whether to use this circuit at all (we don't want to inhibit duplicated names when, eg, figuring out what goes at the start of the <i>next</i> sentence), and may be parts towards the end of the model that do \"post-processing\" just before the final output.

    "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we fixed the scale factor, the LayerNorm would be fully linear. And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant.

    "The standard way to compute the output of an attention layer is by concatenating the mixed values of each head, and multiplying by a big output weight matrix. But as described in [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) this is equivalent to splitting the output weight matrix into a per-head output (here `model.blocks[k].attn.W_O`) and adding them up (including an overall bias term for the entire layer)\n",

These correspond to (some of) the name movers and negative name movers discussed in the paper. There are also several heads that matter positively or negatively but less strongly (other name movers and backup name movers)\n",

    "There are a few meta observations worth making here - our model has 144 heads, yet we could localise this behaviour to a handful of specific heads, using straightforward, general techniques. This supports the claim in [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) that attention heads are the right level of abstraction to understand attention. It also really surprising that there are *negative* heads - eg L10H7 makes the incorrect logit 7x *more* likely. I'm not sure what's going on there, though the paper discusses some possibilities."

Especially later on in the model, there may be components in the residual stream that are nothing to do with the input token!

    "**This section explains how to do activation patching conceptually by implementing it from scratch. To use it in practice with TransformerLens, see [this demonstration instead](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Activation_Patching_in_TL_Demo.ipynb)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious limitation to the techniques used above is that they only look at the very end of the circuit - the parts that directly affect the logits. Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "The technique we'll use to investigate this is called **activation patching**. This was first introduced in [David Bau and Kevin Meng's excellent ROME paper](https://rome.baulab.info/), there called causal tracing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then iterate over many possible activations and look at how much they affect the corrupted run. If patching in an activation significantly increases the probability of the correct answer, this allows us to *localise* which activations matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to localise is a key move in mechanistic interpretability - if the computation is diffuse and spread across the entire model, it is likely much harder to form a clean mechanistic story for what's going on. But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an animation from the ROME paper demonstrating this technique (they studied factual recall, and use stars to represent corruption applied to the subject of the sentence, but the same principles apply):\n",
    "\n",
    "![CT Animation](https://rome.baulab.info/images/small-ct-animation.gif)\n",

    "The above was all fairly abstract, so let's zoom in and lay out a concrete example to understand Indirect Object Identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our clean input will be eg \"After John and Mary went to the store, **John** gave a bottle of milk to\" and our corrupted input will be eg \"After John and Mary went to the store, **Mary** gave a bottle of milk to\". These prompts are identical except for the name of the indirect object, and so patching is a causal intervention which will allow us to understand precisely which parts of the network are identifying the indirect object. \n",
    "\n",
    "One natural thing to patch in is the residual stream at a specific layer and specific position. For example, the model is likely initially doing some processing on the second subject token to realise that it's a duplicate, but then uses attention to move that information to the \" to\" token. So patching in the residual stream at the \" to\" token will likely matter a lot in later layers but not at all in early layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can zoom in much further and patch in specific activations from specific layers. For example, we think that the output of head L9H9 on the final token is significant for directly connecting to the logits\n",
    "\n",
    "We can patch in specific activations, and can zoom in as far as seems reasonable. For example, if we patch in the output of head L9H9 on the final token, we would predict that it will significantly affect performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this technique does *not* tell us how the components of the circuit connect up, just what they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "<details> <summary>Technical details</summary> \n",
    "The choice of clean and corrupted prompt has both pros and cons. By carefully setting up the counterfactual, that <i>only</i> differs in the second subject, we avoid detecting the parts of the model doing irrelevant computation like detecting that the indirect object task is relevant at all or that it should be outputting a name rather than an article or pronoun. Or even context like that John and Mary are names at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it *also* bakes in some details that *are* relevant to the task. Such as finding the location of the second subject, and of the names in the first clause. Or that the name mover heads have learned to copy whatever they look at. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these could be patched by also changing up the order of the names in the original sentence - patching in \"After <b>John and Mary</b> went to the store, John gave a bottle of milk to\" vs \"After <b>Mary and John</b> went to the store, John gave a bottle of milk to\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ROME paper they take a different tack. Rather than carefully setting up counterfactuals between two different but related inputs, they **corrupt** the clean input by adding Gaussian noise to the token embedding for the subject. This is in some ways much lower effort (you don't need to set up a similar but different prompt) but can also introduce some issues, such as ways this noise might break things. In practice, you should take care about how you choose your counterfactuals and try out several. Try to reason beforehand about what they will and will not tell you, and compare the results between different counterfactuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "I discuss some of these limitations and how the author's solved them with much more refined usage of these techniques <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo\">in our interview</a>\n",

    "We see that several attention layers are significant but that, matching the residual stream results, early layers matter on the second subject token, and later layers matter on the final token, and layers essentially don't matter on any other token. Extremely localised! As with direct logit attribution, layer 9 is positive and layers 10 and 11 are not, suggesting that the late layers only matter for direct logit effects, but we also see that layers 7 and 8 matter significantly. Presumably these are the heads that move information about which name is duplicated from the second subject token to the final token."

My current best guess is that the first MLP layer is essentially acting as an extension of the embedding (for whatever reason) and that when later layers want to access the input tokens they mostly read in the output of the first MLP layer, rather than the token embeddings. Within this frame, the first attention layer doesn't do much. \n",

This is pretty unprincipled, as the tasks of embedding and unembedding tokens are <i>not</i> inverses, but this is common practice, and plausibly models want to dedicate some parameters to overcoming this. \n",

    "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. (See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [my walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition. If you're not familiar with the details of how attention is implemented, I recommend checking out [my clean transformer implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=3Pb0NYbZ900e) to see how the code works))"

We've found 3 categories of heads that matter a lot - early heads (L5H5, L6H9, L3H0) whose output matters on the second subject and whose behaviour is determined by their attention patterns, mid-late heads (L8H6, L8H10, L7H9, L7H3) whose output matters on the final token and whose behaviour is determined by their value vectors, and late heads (L9H9, L10H7, L11H10) whose output matters on the final token and whose behaviour is determined by their attention patterns.\n",

    "The heads form three categories corresponding to the early, middle and late categories we found and we did fairly well! Definitely not perfect, but with some fairly generic techniques and some a priori reasoning, we found the broad strokes of the circuit and what it looks like. We focused on the most important heads, so we didn't find all relevant heads in each category (especially not the heads in brackets, which are more minor), but this serves as a good base for doing more rigorous and involved analysis, especially for finding the *complete* circuit (ie all of the parts of the model which participate in this behaviour) rather than just a partial and suggestive circuit. Go check out [their paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) or [our interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo) to learn more about what they did and what they found!\n",

    "* Early: The duplicate token heads, previous token heads and induction heads. These serve the purpose of detecting that the second subject is duplicated and which earlier name is the duplicate.\n",
    "    * We found a direct duplicate token head which behaves exactly as expected, L3H0. Heads L5H0 and L6H9 are induction heads, which explains why they don't attend directly to the earlier copy of John!\n",
    "    * Note that the duplicate token heads and induction heads do not compose with each other - both directly add to the S-Inhibition heads. The diagram is somewhat misleading.\n",
    "* Middle: They call these S-Inhibition heads - they copy the information about the duplicate token from the second subject to the to token, and their output is used to *inhibit* the attention paid from the name movers to the first subject copy. We found all these heads, and had a decent guess for what they did.\n",
    "    * In either case they attend to the second subject, so the patch that mattered was their value vectors!\n",
    "* Late: They call these name movers, and we found some of them. They attend from the final token to the indirect object name and copy that to the logits, using the S-Inhibition heads to inhibit attention to the first copy of the subject token.\n",
    "    * We did find their surprising result of *negative* name movers - name movers that inhibit the correct answer!\n",
    "    * They have an entire category of heads we missed called backup name movers - we'll get to these later.\n",

    "### Early Heads are Induction Heads(?!)\n",
    "\n",
    "A really weird observation is that some of the early heads detecting duplicated tokens are induction heads, not just direct duplicate token heads. This is very weird! What's up with that? \n",
    "\n",
    "First off, what's an induction head? An induction head is an important type of attention head that can detect and continue repeated sequences. It is the second head in a two head induction circuit, which looks for previous copies of the current token and attends to the token *after* it, and then copies that to the current position and predicts that it will come next. They're enough of a big deal that [we wrote a whole paper on them](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Move image demo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNWAzXjVEAEOGRe.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, why is it surprising that they come up here? It's surprising because it feels like overkill. The model doesn't care about *what* token comes after the first copy of the subject, just that it's duplicated. And it already has simpler duplicate token heads. My best guess is that it just already had induction heads around and that, in addition to their main function, they *also* only activate on duplicated tokens. So it was useful to repurpose this existing machinery. \n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that as we look for circuits in larger models life may get more and more complicated, as components in simpler circuits get repurposed and built upon. "

    "One implication of this is that it's useful to categories heads according to whether they occur in\n",
    "simpler circuits, so that as we look for more complex circuits we can easily look for them. This is\n",
    "easy to do here! An interesting fact about induction heads is that they work on a sequence of\n",
    "repeated random tokens - notable for being wildly off distribution from the natural language GPT-2\n",
    "was trained on. Being able to predict a model's behaviour off distribution is a good mark of success\n",
    "for mechanistic interpretability! This is a good sanity check for whether a head is an induction\n",
    "head or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can characterise an induction head by just giving a sequence of random tokens repeated once, and\n",
    "measuring the average attention paid from the second copy of a token to the token after the first\n",
    "copy. At the same time, we can also measure the average attention paid from the second copy of a\n",
    "token to the first copy of the token, which is the attention that the induction head would pay if it\n",
    "were a duplicate token head, and the average attention paid to the previous token to find previous\n",
    "token heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a superficial study of whether something is an induction head - we totally ignore\n",
    "the question of whether it actually does boost the correct token or whether it composes with a\n",
    "single previous head and how. In particular, we sometimes get anti-induction heads which suppress\n",
    "the induction-y token (no clue why!), and this technique will find those too . But given the\n",

    "\"blocks.{layer}.{layer_type}.hook_{activation_name}\" in general, here it's\n",
    "\"blocks.{layer}.attn.hook_attn\". And it has shape [batch, head_index, query_pos, token_pos]. Our\n",

    "duplicate tokens (the distance to earlier copies) and seq_len-1 to get induction heads (the distance\n",

    "Another fascinating anomaly is that of the **backup name mover heads**. A standard technique to apply when interpreting model internals is ablations, or knock-out. If we run the model but intervene to set a specific head to zero, what happens? If the model is robust to this intervention, then naively we can be confident that the head is not doing anything important, and conversely if the model is much worse at the task this suggests that head was important. There are several conceptual flaws with this approach, making the evidence only suggestive, eg that the average output of the head may be far from zero and so the knockout may send it far from expected activations, breaking internals on *any* task. But it's still an easy technique to apply to give some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a wild finding in the paper is that models have **built in redundancy**. If we knock out one of the name movers, then there are some backup name movers in later layers that *change their behaviour* and do (some of) the job of the original name mover head. This means that naive knock-out will significantly underestimate the importance of the name movers.\n"

    "Let's test this! Let's ablate the most important name mover (head L9H9) on just the final token using a custom ablation hook and then cache all new activations and compared performance. We focus on the final position because we want to specifically ablate the direct logit effect. When we do this, we see that naively, removing the top name mover should reduce the logit diff massively, from 3.55 to 0.57. **But actually, it only goes down to 2.99!**\n",

    "Ablating heads is really easy in TransformerLens! We can just define a hook on the z activation in the relevant attention layer (recall, z is the mixed values, and comes immediately before multiplying by the output weights $W_O$). z has a head_index axis, so we can set the component for the relevant head and for position -1 to zero, and return it. (Technically we could just edit in place without returning it, but by convention we always return an edited activation). \n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to compare all internal activations with a hook, which is hard to do with the nice `run_with_hooks` API. So we can directly access the hook on the z activation with `model.blocks[layer].attn.hook_z` and call its `add_hook` method. This adds in the hook to the *global state* of the model. We can now use run_with_cache, and don't need to care about the global state, because run_with_cache internally adds a bunch of caching hooks, and then removes all hooks after the run, *including* the previously added ablation hook. This can be disabled with the reset_hooks_end flag, but here it's useful! \n",
